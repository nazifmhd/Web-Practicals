    <h1><font color="Red"><i>How does open source software work?</i></font></h1>
    <p><mark>Open source code</mark> is typically stored in a <b>public repository</b>, or repo, which anyone may access, contribute to, and share
        <font size="4">(depending on permissions)</font>. <tt>Contributors upload new versions of the code to the project</tt>, building and improving
        on the existing work to deliver new features and updates. All the work is performed publicly in the repo so that anyone may
        add to it. The code usually comes with a license,<strike>which defines what a user can and
        cannot do with the software.</strike> <font color="green">Some licenses are permissive and allow you to use and distribute the code for any purpose, while others may require that you explicitly log
        any changes when you share. Other licenses may stipulate that all copies of the source code be free and available for public
        use.</font> Some of today's most popular licenses include:</p>

    <p><h3><font color="Gray"><i>MIT</i></font></h3></p>
    <p><i><font color="gray">The MIT license carries veryfew restrictions on what can be done with 
        the source code, which makes it the most permissive and widely used free license. 
        All the license requires is that future versions of the code must include the original 
        copyright notice and a copy of the license itself.</font></i></p>

    <H3><i><FONT COLOR="brown" face="Comic San Ms">GNU General Public license (GPL) v2</FONT></i></H3>
    <p><font color="brown"><i>Created by the GNU Project, GPLv2 explicitly requires that source code be made available for public use. GPLv2 is also a
        copyleft license, which means that any version of the source code must also be released under the same license, GPLv2.
    </i></font></p>

    <h3><font color="green"><i>GNU GPLv3</i></font></h3>
    <p><font color="green"><i>Like its predecessor, GPLv3 also requires future versions of the code to be released under the same license. Unlike GPLv2,
        GPLv3 is compatible with the popular Apache 2. O license, specifically addresses patent rights, and does not require that source
        code be made available to the public.</i></font></p>

    <h3><font color="blue"><i>Apache 2.0</i></font></h3>
    <p><font color="blue"><i>Much like the MIT license, the Apache 2.0 license is a popular and permissive software license that allows users to do anything
        they want with the codeâ€”so long as they log any major changes made.NffT The MIT license carries veryfew restrictions on
        what can be done with the source code, which makes it the most permissive and widely used free license. All the license
        requires is that future versions of the code must include the original copyright notice and a copy of the license itself.</i></font></p>
