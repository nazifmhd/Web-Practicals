			<p class="margin">Machine learning is a branch of AI which focuses on the use of data and 
			algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy.
			Machine learning algorithms are trained to find relationships and patterns in data. 
			They use historical data as input to make predictions, classify information and cluster data points.
